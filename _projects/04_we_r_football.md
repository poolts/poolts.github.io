## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

**We R Football** is a first-person football game where players take on the role of both manager and footballer. Unlike traditional football management games, We R Football places the user inside the action, allowing them to experience matches from a first-person perspective, make tactical decisions, and manage team progression throughout the season.

The game combines immersive 3D gameplay with a long-term management sim, allowing players to train, transfer, compete in leagues and improve their squad over time.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Unity** (client-side 3D gameplay and UI)
- **Node.js** (backend services, progression, matchmaking)
- **MongoDB** (player data and team state storage)

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **First-Person Match Play**  
  Play from the perspective of your selected player with real-time control during matches.  
- **Football Management Layer**

  Designed for browser and mobile deployment.
