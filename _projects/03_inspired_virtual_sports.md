## 📋 Project Overview

Inspired's virtual betting games allow users to place real-money bets on fast-paced, simulated sporting events. 

These games combine the simplicity of slot machines with high-quality sports animations to create an immersive and engaging experience.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **WebGL**
- **HTML/CSS**

## 🔑 Key Features

- Users can place bets on the outcomes of virtual sporting events, such as horse racing, football, or greyhound racing  
- Probabilities and outcomes are resolved using rule-based logic and weighted randomisation  
- Events play out in short cycles with realistic 3D animation and commentary  
- Includes bespoke games such as 3D virtual bingo using WebGL

## 👨 My Role

- Led development across multiple virtual sports betting titles  
- Designed and implemented backend logic to calculate probabilities and resolve bets  
- Contributed to frontend UI development using HTML and CSS  
- Developed 3D interactive elements using WebGL, including a fully animated bingo game
