## Project Overview
The **Virtual Bird Table** is a military briefing and planning tool that lets distributed teams visualise and manipulate units on a shared map in real time. Built for austere networks, it replaces manual, printed tables with a collaborative XR/VR experience, so commanders and staff can plan from anywhere in the world without the need to be co-located.

## Tech Stack
- **Clients:** Unity (XR, VR, Windows Standalone) 
- **Server:** .NET, Docker
- **SDKs & Integrations:** [ArcGIS Maps SDK for Unity](https://developers.arcgis.com/unity/), [MilSymbol Server](https://github.com/spatialillusions/milsymbol-server)

## Key Features
- **Distributed Command**  
  Real-time, multi-user briefing & planning from anywhere in the world. Eliminates the need to co-locate.
- **Real-time Accurate Avatars**  
  See teammates‚Äô head abd hand movements in real-time high fidelity.
- **Interactive Map**  
  Pan, zoom, and scale a shared map with 2D or 3D terrain and buildings.  
- **Unit Symbology & Manipulation**  
  Drag-and-drop NATO-standard units to simulate complex miltary scenarios.
- **Live Annotations & Layers**  
  Annotate the map using free-hand drawing and resizable shapes. Toggle grouped elements on the map (e.g. units, drawings, shapes) to avoid visual clutter.  
- **State Persistence**  
  Save/load map states (position, scale, units) to switch between scenarios instantly.  
- **Austere-Network Optimization**  
  Custom serialisation and compression to minimize bandwidth usage over low-rate links.
