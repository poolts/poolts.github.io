## Project Overview
The **Virtual Bird Table** is a military briefing and planning tool that lets distributed teams visualise and manipulate units on a shared map in real time. Built for austere networks, it replaces manual, printed tables with a collaborative XR/VR experience, so commanders and staff can plan from anywhere in the world without the need to be collocated.

## Tech Stack
- **Clients:** Unity (XR, VR, Windows Standalone) 
- **Server:** .NET, Docker
- **Maps** ArcGIS integration

## Key Features
- **Distributed Command**  
  Real-time, multi-user briefing & planning from anywhere in the world.  
- **Full-Body Avatars**  
  See teammates‚Äô head & hand movements in high fidelity via articulated XR rigs.  
- **Interactive Map**  
  Pan, zoom, and scale a shared map with 3D terrain/buildings‚Äîno paper required.  
- **Unit Symbology & Manipulation**  
  Drag-and-drop NATO-standard units to simulate scenarios.  
- **Live Annotations**  
  Free-hand drawing and resizable shapes via the briefer‚Äôs laptop app.  
- **State Persistence**  
  Save/load complete map states (position, scale, units) to switch between scenarios instantly.  
- **Austere-Network Optimization**  
  Custom serialization and compression to minimize bandwidth usage over low-rate links.
