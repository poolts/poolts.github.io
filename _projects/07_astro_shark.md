**Astro Shark** is a fast-paced mobile action game that tells the story of a lovesick shark jetting through the cosmos in search of his captured beloved. Combining fluid controls with a stylised art direction, the game immerses players in a beautifully animated universe filled with explosive obstacles, planetary slingshots, and unexpected space hazards.

The game was developed and shipped within a tight 12-week schedule, and received praise for its fluid gameplay, vibrant visuals, and emotional narrative.
