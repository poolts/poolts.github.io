## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This breast cancer awareness app was developed in partnership with Roche to support healthcare practitioners (HCPs) in explaining the breast cancer journey to patients. The app served as a digital companion in clinical settings, helping to visualise treatment pathways, answer patient questions, and tailor discussions to each individualâ€™s diagnosis.

Built with interactivity and clarity in mind, the tool included both 3D visuals and structured information screens to improve communication and understanding between patients and clinicians.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Unity**  
- **WebGL** (browser deployment)  
- **PDF Export Library** (for summary reports)

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **3D Anatomical Visualisation**  
  A female torso model allows HCPs to add, scale, and position tumours, assign HER2/node status, and switch between anatomical layers.  
- **Patient Journey Stages**  
  Informational screens covering therapies, surgery, recovery, and support services tailored to different stages.  
- **FAQs & Patient Priorities**  
  Patients can explore frequently asked questions and mark which ones are most important to them.  
- **Treatment Pathway Builder**  
  Clinicians can outline and personalise a patient's expected treatment timeline, including durations for each stage.  
- **Summary Report Generator**  
  All data entered during the session can be exported as a printable PDF to support post-consultation reflection.

## ðŸ‘¨ My Role

- Led the entire development lifecycle from initial discovery through to final delivery  
- Defined the application architecture and ensured optimal performance for WebGL deployment  
- Collaborated closely with a UI designer and 3D artist to create an accessible, medically accurate user interface and torso model  
- Implemented all major interactive systems including tumour manipulation, pathway editing and report export  
- Integrated client feedback through iterative design reviews and user testing

## ðŸš€ Lessons Learned & Next Steps
- **Challenges Overcome:** _Supporting high-quality 3D in WebGL, Safari rendering issues, performance on older devices_  
- **Future Enhancements:** _Tablet-native version, multi-language support, in-app analytics for HCP training use_
