## 📋 Project Overview

**I AM PLAYR** was a groundbreaking football game that combined first-person perspective gameplay with interactive storytelling. Players lived the life of a professional footballer both on and off the pitch—balancing training, career decisions, and media appearances, while experiencing 3D match-day moments through immersive gameplay.

The game featured a rich narrative delivered through filmed live-action scenes, interspersed with interactive choices and football challenges. It was one of the first titles to blur the line between video game and episodic drama.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Unity** (3D match engine)
- **Flash / HTML5** (legacy 2D web components)
- **Node.js** (backend systems and live operations)
- **MongoDB** (player progression and content state)
- **Custom CMS tools** for managing story content and player choices

## 🔑 Key Features

- **First-Person Football Gameplay**  
  Experience match-day events from the perspective of your player using a 3D football engine.  
- **Interactive Narrative**  
  Make off-pitch decisions that impact career progression, relationships, and sponsorships.  
- **Live-Action Cutscenes**  
  Professionally filmed scenes integrated seamlessly with gameplay.  
- **Integrated Sponsorships**  
  Real-world brands like Nike, Gillette, and Red Bull were featured in-game.  
- **Progression & Stats**  
  Train, earn skill upgrades, and build your footballer’s legacy season after season.  

## 👨 My Role

- **Led development on the mobile version** of I AM PLAYR, adapting the experience for touch-based platforms.  
- On the web version, helped **transition the match-day minigame from 2D sprites to a full 3D football experience** using Unity.  
- This 3D engine was later evolved into a standalone title: **We R Football**.  
- Worked closely with designers, producers, and marketing teams to integrate narrative, gameplay, and sponsorship elements cohesively.
