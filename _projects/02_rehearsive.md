## 📋 Project Overview
Rehearsive is a real-time collaborative application that lets users import and visualise their CAD models in either solo or shared sessions. Whether on desktop or in VR, teams can walk around a 1:1 scale model or view it as a tabletop simulation to rehearse design and construction workflows together.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Unity** (VR & Windows Standalone)  
- **Photon PUN** for real-time networking  
- **Azure SignalR** & **Blob Storage** for cloud sync and asset hosting  

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Model Import & Visualisation**  
  Load and explore CAD/3D models on desktop or VR headsets (with the ability to load in previously imported models)
- **Collaborative Sessions**  
  Host or join sessions and invite other users via app links.  
- **Scale Modes**  
  Switch between full-scale walkthroughs and miniaturised tabletop views.  
- **Asset Catalogue**  
  Drag items (machinery, fences, containers) from an in-app catalogue into the scene.  
- **Interactive Machinery**  
  Operate cranes, diggers, and cherry-pickers with realistic controls.  
- **Annotations**  
  Draw directly on models or place text signs to highlight issues. 
- **Save and Load States**  
  Once the scene has been set and annotated you can save and re-load the states at any time.
- **Environmental Simulation**  
  Adjust time of day and weather (rain, fog, snow, clear) to plan for all conditions.

## 👨 My Role
- Led the technical development and architecture design.
- Code-reviewed and mentored team members.
- Scoped features in collaboration with internal and external stakeholders.  
- Assisted in hiring and onboarding new team members.

## 🛠 Technical Deep Dive
> _TBC—add any architecture diagrams, core algorithms (e.g., network sync, asset streaming), or performance optimisations here._
 
## 🚀 Lessons Learned & Next Steps
- **Challenges Overcome:** _e.g., network reliability vs. update fidelity; VR UX considerations_  
- **Future Enhancements:** _e.g., AI-driven clash detection, offline mode, mobile/tablet support_
